# stim-gen
A Python tool for generating complex stimulation patterns for whole-cell electrophysiological experiments.

Defines a Stim class with built-in methods to generate a variety of
stimulation patterns for whole-cell recording, including simulated 
synaptic currents, arbitrarily complex sine waves, and skewed Gaussian
random walk noise.

Uses the following dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, and numba.
